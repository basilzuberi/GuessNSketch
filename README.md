A Pictionary game created with teammates for Internet Computing class. stay tuned.

## Made using Node, Express.js and Socket.io

-Download Repo and move to folder

-run "npm init" (need Node installed), keep pressing enter

-run "npm install express --save" (gives us ability to use http requests for web framework)

-run "npm install socket.io" (gives us ability to create a server that lets multiple clients connect)

-run "npm install mongodb --save" (for the game database)

The .gitignore file helps us not include the Node Package files when we commit the project.

This way we can keep the modules on our computers and not have random files inside the Git Repository.

It also helps us keep Environment Variables (Where we should store keys for APIs) out of the repo so no one can access our keys.
